[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jelford/project_euler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jelford/project_euler)

Contains code for Project Euler problems, in rust.

This is a project for me to learn Rust with some hands-on problems; it's unlikely to be either good rust or good maths.

# Build

    cargo test

# Run

When run, answers will be printed on the screen for each problem solves so far. There are no options.

    cargo run

...or:

    cargo build --release
    ./target/release/project_euler

example output:

    01: 233168
    02: 4613732
    03: 6857
    04: 906609
    05: 232792560
